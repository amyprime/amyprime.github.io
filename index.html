<p>Here are some pages I have produced for <a href="https://fairdistrictspa.com/"> Fair Districts PA</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that these pages contain minimal formatting because they are intended to be embedded inside a larger page.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="https://fdpa.github.io/maps/redistricting-slider.html">redistricting slider</a> shows the difference between former and proposed district maps.</li>

<li>The "<a href="https://fairdistrictspa.com:8443/airtable/test/cyl.html">contact your legislator</a>" page provides current legislators' contact information and voting history.</li>

<li>The "<a href="https://fdpa.github.io/legislators/kbyv-2024.html">know before you vote</a>" page informs people about the candidates in their local elections.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://fdpa.github.io/resolutions/">resolutions map</a> allows people to explore whether their municipality or county has passed a resolution in favor of fair districts.</li>

</ul>
